üöÄWebpack Boilerplate Template

A modern, streamlined JavaScript boilerplate template utilizing Webpack for efficient development and optimized production builds.

‚ú® Overview

This repository is designed to give you a fast, feature-rich starting point for any web project. It uses Webpack to manage your assets, modules, and dependencies, ensuring a smooth developer experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and an optimized final output.

All your source code is expected to reside within the src/ directory.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

Single Source Directory: All development happens inside the src/ folder.

In-Memory Development Server: Fast compilation and serving without writing intermediary files to disk.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Changes to modules are instantly updated in the browser without a full page reload, preserving application state.

Live Reload: Fallback for immediate browser refresh on file changes (e.g., changes to HTML or configuration).

Production-Ready Output: Generates clean, optimized bundles into a dedicated dist/ folder.

üíª Getting Started

1. Installation

To get the project running, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

# Clone the repository
git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd [your-repo-name]

# Install dependencies
npm install


üèÉ Usage

There are two primary scripts for working with this template: Development and Production.

1. Development Mode (npm run dev)

This script starts the development server, enabling HMR and Live Reload.

npm run dev


How it works:

Webpack Search: Webpack locates all entry points and dependencies within the src/ directory.

In-Memory Bundling: The code is bundled immediately, but the resulting files are not written to your disk (they are stored in the server's memory).

Fast Feedback: This in-memory approach makes the build process incredibly fast, providing near-instantaneous updates via HMR as you save changes.

The application is typically served on http://localhost:[PORT].

2. Production Mode (Building for Deployment)

This script bundles and optimizes the code for production, writing the final files to a deployment-ready folder.

npm run build


How it works:

Webpack Search: Webpack reads all source files from src/.

Optimization: Code is typically minified, tree-shaken, and optimized for load speed.

Output: The final, bundled assets (JS, CSS, images, etc.) are written into the dist/ folder.

The contents of the dist/ folder are what you should upload to your web server for deployment.
